# Tailwind CSS Migration Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for migrating the Independent Study Dashboard from custom CSS to Tailwind CSS while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Migration Overview

The migration follows a **utility-first approach** with careful preservation of existing functionality. Each phase builds incrementally without breaking changes.

## Phase 0: Foundation (âœ… **COMPLETED**)
**Current Phase** - Establish Tailwind CSS infrastructure

### Completed
- âœ… Added Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer as dev dependencies
- âœ… Created `tailwind.config.js` with content paths and extended theme
- âœ… Created `postcss.config.js` for build integration
- âœ… Restructured CSS architecture:
  - `src/styles/globals.css`: Tailwind directives + CSS variables
  - `src/styles/legacy.css`: All existing component classes (`.btn`, `.card`, etc.)
- âœ… Cleaned up login page (removed demo UI elements: "View Phase 2 UI Demo", "View Dashboard Demo", "or" separator)
- âœ… Applied initial Tailwind utility classes to login page layout
- âœ… Added optional build SHA console logging capability

### Technical Details
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing CSS class names (`.btn-primary`, `.card`, `.header`, etc.) continue to work
- **Design System Mapping**: Tailwind theme extended with existing color palette and spacing system
- **Build Integration**: Tailwind processes through PostCSS pipeline, no React Scripts changes required

## Phase 1: Design Tokens & Primitives (ðŸ”„ **PLANNED**)
**Next Phase** - Create reusable design tokens and shared components

### Objectives
- Create centralized design tokens for colors, spacing, typography, and shadows
- Build shared component primitives using Tailwind utilities
- Establish component library foundation

### Planned Work
- **Design Tokens**
  - Extract color palette to Tailwind theme configuration
  - Define consistent spacing scale and typography system
  - Create custom utilities for project-specific patterns

- **Component Primitives**
  - `<Button>` component with variants (primary, secondary, success, danger)
  - `<Card>` component with header, body, and footer slots
  - `<Input>`, `<Select>`, `<Textarea>` form components
  - `<Badge>` component for status indicators

- **Utility Patterns**
  - Focus ring utilities for accessibility
  - Loading state patterns
  - Hover and interaction state conventions

### Success Criteria
- All new components use Tailwind utilities exclusively
- Consistent design token usage across components
- Legacy classes still functional for existing components
- Documentation of component API and usage patterns

### Objectives
- Replace segmented filter controls with Tailwind-based components
- Migrate goal and reflection content cards
- Implement advanced interaction patterns

### Planned Work
- **Segmented Control Component**
  - Build accessible segmented control with keyboard navigation
  - Implement selection states and smooth transitions
  - Support multiple variants and sizing options

- **Content Cards**
  - Migrate goal cards, reflection cards, and meeting history
  - Implement consistent card actions and states
  - Add interactive features (expand/collapse, inline editing)

- **Form Components**
  - Upgrade form inputs to use shared primitives
  - Implement validation states and error handling
  - Add form layout utilities and patterns

### Success Criteria
- All interactive controls are accessible and keyboard navigable
- Content cards provide consistent user experience
- Form validation and states work seamlessly
- Component reusability demonstrated across different contexts

## Phase 4: Empty States & Loading Patterns (ðŸ”„ **PLANNED**)
**Target Phase** - Polish user experience with consistent feedback

### Objectives
- Implement skeleton loading components
- Create empty state patterns and illustrations
- Standardize loading and error states

### Planned Work
- **Skeleton Components**
  - Card skeleton with configurable content blocks
  - List item skeletons for various content types
  - Grid layout skeletons for dashboard states

- **Empty States**
  - Goal tracking empty state
  - Reflection history empty state
  - Meeting schedule empty state
  - Consistent illustration style and messaging

- **Loading & Error States**
  - Standardized loading spinners and progress indicators
  - Error boundary components with user-friendly messaging
  - Retry patterns and user guidance

### Success Criteria
- Perceived performance improved with skeleton loading
- Empty states guide users toward productive actions
- Error states provide clear recovery paths
- Consistent visual feedback across all application states

## Phase 5: Accessibility & Interaction Polish (ðŸ”„ **PLANNED**)
**Final Phase** - Comprehensive accessibility and interaction refinement

### Objectives
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
- Implement advanced interaction patterns and animations
- Prepare foundation for dark mode support

### Planned Work
- **Accessibility Audit**
  - Screen reader compatibility testing
  - Keyboard navigation verification
  - Color contrast validation
  - Focus management improvements

- **Interaction Polish**
  - Smooth transitions and micro-animations
  - Advanced hover and focus states
  - Touch-friendly interaction targets

  - Create dark mode toggle infrastructure
  - Test component compatibility with dark themes

### Success Criteria
- Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved
- Smooth, polished user interactions
- Foundation ready for dark mode implementation
- Performance optimized for production use

## Development Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- **Tailwind Utilities**: Use standard Tailwind class names (`bg-primary-600`, `text-gray-900`)
- **Custom Components**: PascalCase for React components (`<Button>`, `<Card>`)
- **CSS Variables**: Keep existing pattern (`--color-primary-600`, `--space-4`)
- **Legacy Classes**: Maintain existing names during transition (`.btn-primary`, `.card-header`)

### When to Convert vs Keep Legacy
**Convert to Tailwind When:**
- Creating new components or pages
- Significant refactoring of existing components
- Opportunity to improve responsive behavior
- Need for better maintainability

**Keep Legacy Classes When:**
- Component works well and needs no changes
- Risk of breaking existing functionality
- Complex component that would require significant testing
- Time constraints prioritize other work

### Utility-First Guidelines
1. **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex components by composing simple utilities
2. **Responsive by Default**: Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`) consistently
3. **Semantic Grouping**: Group related utilities logically in class lists
4. **Performance Aware**: Leverage Tailwind's purging for optimal bundle size

### Accessibility Focus States
- Use `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary-500 focus:ring-offset-2` for interactive elements
- Maintain `:focus-visible` support for keyboard-only focus indicators
- Ensure minimum 44px touch targets on mobile devices
- Test with screen readers during development

### Dark Mode Placeholder
While not implemented in the current phases, the foundation supports future dark mode implementation:

```css
/* Example dark mode tokens (future implementation) */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --color-gray-50: #111827;
    --color-gray-900: #f9fafb;
    /* Additional dark mode variables */
  }
}
```

## Migration Tools & Resources

### Development Tools
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**: VS Code extension for autocomplete and linting
- **Headless UI**: Consider for complex interactive components (future phases)
- **Tailwind UI**: Reference for component patterns and best practices

### Testing Strategy
- **Visual Regression**: Compare before/after screenshots for each migrated component
- **Responsive Testing**: Verify layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- **Accessibility Testing**: Use tools like axe-core and manual screen reader testing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track bundle size and rendering performance

### Documentation Standards
- Document component APIs and usage examples
- Maintain changelog of migration progress
- Create visual component library (Storybook consideration for future)
- Keep migration decision log for future reference
