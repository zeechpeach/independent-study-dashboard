# Tailwind CSS Migration Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for migrating the Independent Study Dashboard from custom CSS to Tailwind CSS while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Migration Overview

The migration follows a **utility-first approach** with careful preservation of existing functionality. Each phase builds incrementally without breaking changes.

## Phase 0: Foundation (âœ… **COMPLETED**)
**Current Phase** - Establish Tailwind CSS infrastructure

### Completed
- âœ… Added Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer as dev dependencies
- âœ… Created `tailwind.config.js` with content paths and extended theme
- âœ… Created `postcss.config.js` for build integration
- âœ… Restructured CSS architecture:
  - `src/styles/globals.css`: Tailwind directives + CSS variables
  - `src/styles/legacy.css`: All existing component classes (`.btn`, `.card`, etc.)
- âœ… Cleaned up login page (removed demo UI elements: "View Phase 2 UI Demo", "View Dashboard Demo", "or" separator)
- âœ… Applied initial Tailwind utility classes to login page layout
- âœ… Added optional build SHA console logging capability

### Technical Details
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing CSS class names (`.btn-primary`, `.card`, `.header`, etc.) continue to work
- **Design System Mapping**: Tailwind theme extended with existing color palette and spacing system
- **Build Integration**: Tailwind processes through PostCSS pipeline, no React Scripts changes required

## Phase 1: Design Tokens & Primitives (ðŸ”„ **PLANNED**)
**Next Phase** - Create reusable design tokens and shared components

### Objectives
- Create centralized design tokens for colors, spacing, typography, and shadows
- Build shared component primitives using Tailwind utilities
- Establish component library foundation

### Planned Work
- **Design Tokens**
  - Extract color palette to Tailwind theme configuration
  - Define consistent spacing scale and typography system
  - Create custom utilities for project-specific patterns

- **Component Primitives**
  - `<Button>` component with variants (primary, secondary, success, danger)
  - `<Card>` component with header, body, and footer slots
  - `<Input>`, `<Select>`, `<Textarea>` form components
  - `<Badge>` component for status indicators

- **Utility Patterns**
  - Focus ring utilities for accessibility
  - Loading state patterns
  - Hover and interaction state conventions

### Success Criteria
- All new components use Tailwind utilities exclusively
- Consistent design token usage across components
- Legacy classes still functional for existing components
- Documentation of component API and usage patterns

## Phase 2: Dashboard Layout & Quick Actions (âœ… **COMPLETED**)
**Target Phase** - Migrate core dashboard layout and interactive elements

### Completed
- âœ… Created AppShell layout wrapper component with Tailwind utilities
- âœ… Created responsive DashboardGrid component replacing legacy layout classes
- âœ… Created GridContainer component for responsive grid layouts
- âœ… Migrated Student Dashboard to use new DashboardGrid components
- âœ… Updated App.js to use AppShell wrapper with integrated header
- âœ… Updated AdminDashboard to use GridContainer for consistent grid layouts
- âœ… Replaced `.dashboard-layout`, `.dashboard-main`, `.dashboard-sidebar` with Tailwind utilities
- âœ… Replaced `.grid-2`, `.grid-3` classes with responsive GridContainer component
- âœ… Maintained visual parity with existing design
- âœ… Ensured responsive behavior across all screen sizes

### Technical Implementation
- **AppShell Component**: Centralized layout wrapper with header, user controls, and main content area
- **DashboardGrid Components**: 
  - `DashboardGrid`: Main responsive 3-column layout container
  - `DashboardGrid.Main`: 2/3 width main content area
  - `DashboardGrid.Sidebar`: 1/3 width sidebar area
- **GridContainer Component**: Flexible responsive grid with configurable columns (1-6 columns)
- **Responsive Design**: Automatic stacking on mobile, optimized spacing and gaps

## Phase 3A: Advisor Structural Migration (âœ… **COMPLETED**)
**Current Phase** - Introduce advisor-specific layout structure without changing business logic

### Completed
- âœ… Created feature flag system (`featureFlags.ts`) with `advisorLayoutV2` flag (default: true)
- âœ… Added role-based type system (`roles.ts`) with UserRole union: 'student' | 'advisor' | 'sysadmin'
- âœ… Implemented advisor navigation configuration (`roleNav.ts`) with `advisorNavItems` array
- âœ… Generalized AppShell component to support `role="advisor"` prop
- âœ… Created AdvisorAppShell wrapper component for advisor-specific functionality
- âœ… Built AdvisorDashboardGrid component extending base DashboardGrid
- âœ… Added placeholder panels: NeedsAttentionPanel and RecentReflectionsPanel (static stub content)
- âœ… Implemented new /advisor dashboard page using new layout components
- âœ… Preserved legacy admin dashboard as fallback behind feature flag
- âœ… Renamed "Admin" references to "Advisor" in new/modified components

### Technical Implementation
- **Feature Flag Control**: `featureFlags.advisorLayoutV2` determines whether to use new advisor layout vs legacy admin layout
- **Role-Based Architecture**: New role system supports student, advisor, and sysadmin (reserved) roles
- **Layout Components**: 
  - `AdvisorAppShell`: Advisor-specific wrapper around base AppShell
  - `AdvisorDashboardGrid`: Specialized grid layout for advisor workflows
  - `NeedsAttentionPanel`: Static placeholder showing students requiring attention
  - `RecentReflectionsPanel`: Static placeholder for recent student reflections
- **Navigation Structure**: Advisor-specific navigation items focused on student oversight and mentoring
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy admin dashboard remains accessible when feature flag is disabled

### Included in This Phase
- Configuration files for feature flags, roles, and navigation
- Advisor-specific layout components and wrappers
- Placeholder panels with static content for structural validation
- New advisor dashboard page with grid-based layout
- Feature flag integration for gradual rollout

### Excluded from This Phase
- Dynamic data integration (panels show static placeholder content only)
- Full navigation implementation (structural foundation only)
- Role-based permission enforcement (configuration established, enforcement reserved for future phases)
- Advanced advisor-specific functionality (focus on structural migration only)

### Rollback Strategy
- Set `featureFlags.advisorLayoutV2` to `false` to revert to legacy admin dashboard
- All new components are isolated and can be removed without affecting existing functionality
- Base AppShell maintains backward compatibility with existing admin/student toggle behavior

### Next Phases
- **Phase 3B**: Implement dynamic data integration for advisor panels
- **Phase 3C**: Add role-based navigation and permission enforcement
- **Phase 3D**: Enhance advisor-specific features and interactions

## Development Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- **Tailwind Utilities**: Use standard Tailwind class names (`bg-primary-600`, `text-gray-900`)
- **Custom Components**: PascalCase for React components (`<Button>`, `<Card>`)
- **CSS Variables**: Keep existing pattern (`--color-primary-600`, `--space-4`)
- **Legacy Classes**: Maintain existing names during transition (`.btn-primary`, `.card-header`)

### When to Convert vs Keep Legacy
**Convert to Tailwind When:**
- Creating new components or pages
- Significant refactoring of existing components
- Opportunity to improve responsive behavior
- Need for better maintainability

**Keep Legacy Classes When:**
- Component works well and needs no changes
- Risk of breaking existing functionality
- Complex component that would require significant testing
- Time constraints prioritize other work

### Utility-First Guidelines
1. **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex components by composing simple utilities
2. **Responsive by Default**: Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`) consistently
3. **Semantic Grouping**: Group related utilities logically in class lists
4. **Performance Aware**: Leverage Tailwind's purging for optimal bundle size

### Accessibility Focus States
- Use `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary-500 focus:ring-offset-2` for interactive elements
- Maintain `:focus-visible` support for keyboard-only focus indicators
- Ensure minimum 44px touch targets on mobile devices
- Test with screen readers during development

### Dark Mode Placeholder
While not implemented in the current phases, the foundation supports future dark mode implementation:

```css
/* Example dark mode tokens (future implementation) */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --color-gray-50: #111827;
    --color-gray-900: #f9fafb;
    /* Additional dark mode variables */
  }
}
```
