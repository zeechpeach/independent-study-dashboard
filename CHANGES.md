# Changes Summary

## Overview
This document describes the UI/UX improvements made to the Independent Study Dashboard based on the requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Advisor Dashboard - Removed "Needs Review" Section ✅

**Location**: `src/pages/AdvisorDashboard.js`

**What was removed**:
- The "Needs Review" card showing pending reflections count
- The BookOpen icon import
- The 2-column grid layout for stats (simplified to single card)

**Before**: 
- Displayed two stats cards: "Total Students" and "Needs Review" (pending reflections)
- Used a 2-column grid container for layout

**After**:
- Now displays only "Total Students" card
- Cleaner, simpler layout without reflection tracking

**Reason**: There are no reflections to review anymore, making this section obsolete.

3. **Empty State**:

   - Removed button to create first item (form is already visible)

**Before**:
- Users clicked "Add Item" button → navigated to ActionPlan page
- Had to click "Add Item" again in ActionPlan to start typing
- Two-step process to add a simple task

**After**:

### 4. Firebase Service - Added Notes Functions ✅

**Location**: `src/services/firebase.js`

**New Functions Added**:

```javascript
// Create a new note
export const createNote = async (userId, noteData)

// Update an existing note
export const updateNote = async (noteId, noteData)

// Delete a note
export const deleteNote = async (noteId)

// Get all notes for a user
export const getUserNotes = async (userId)
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Notes stored in `notes` collection in Firebase
- Each note has: userId, title, content, createdAt, updatedAt
- Ordered by updatedAt (most recent first)
- Uses serverTimestamp() for accurate timestamps

- No migration needed
